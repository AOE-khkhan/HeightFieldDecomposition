## Abstract
We propose a novel algorithm for decomposing general 3D geometries into a small set of overlap-free height-field blocks, volumes enclosed by a
flat base and a height-field surface defined with respect to this base. This decomposition is useful for fabrication methodologies such as 3-axis CNC
milling, where a single milling pass can only carve a single height-field surface defined with respect to the machine tray, but can also benefit other
fabrication settings. Computing our desired decomposition requires solving a highly constrained discrete optimization problem, variants of which are
known to be NP-hard. We effectively compute a high-quality decomposition by using a two-step process that leverages the unique characteristics of our
setup. Specifically, we notice that if the height-field directions are constrained to the major axes we can always produce a valid decomposition starting
from a suitable surface segmentation. Our method first produces a compact set of large, possibly overlapping, height-field blocks that jointly cover the
model surface by recasting this discrete constrained optimization problem as an unconstrained optimization of a continuous function, which allows
for an efficient solution. We then cast the computation of an overlap-free, final decomposition as an ordering problem on a graph, and solve it via a
combination of cycle elimination and topological sorting. The combined algorithm produces a compact set of height-field blocks that jointly describe
the input model within a user given tolerance. We demonstrate our method on a range of inputs, and showcase a number of real life models manufactured
using our technique.
